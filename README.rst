**Conveyor** is a common Python library and command-line app for LSST the Docs (LTD) services and clients.

Key features:

- ``ltd`` command-line app.

  The ``ltd upload`` subcommand makes it easy to integrate documentation uploads with continuous integration jobs, particularly Travis CI.

- The ``ltdconveyor`` Python package provides APIs for working with LSST the Docs.

  ``ltdconveyor.s3`` subpackage provides S3 object management services.
  All documentation hosted by LTD is served through the `Fastly CDN <https://www.fastly.com>`_, which uses S3 object metadata to purge caches.
  Conveyor ensures that this metadata is properly set by all clients and microservices that upload, copy, or delete objects from S3.

  ``ltdconveyor.fastly`` provides Fastly cache management APIs.

  ``ltdconveyor.keeper`` provides APIs for working with LTD Keeper's REST API.

You can learn more about LTD in our `SQR-006 <https://sqr-006.lsst.io>`_ technote.
