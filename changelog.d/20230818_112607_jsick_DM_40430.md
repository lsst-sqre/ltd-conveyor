### Backwards-incompatible changes

### New features

- Add support for LTD Keeper 2.0. To support this, the `ltd upload` command takes a new `--org` option to set the documentation organization. For LTD Keeper 1.0 users, this option should be omitted.
- The `--project` CLI option is now preferred over `--product`. The `--product` option is still supported, but it will be removed in a future release. This aligns LTD Conveyor with LTD Keeper 2.0's terminology.
